# Differential Acclimation to chronic nutrient enrichment 

This project examines the physilogical effects of chronic nutrient encirhment on 2 species of reef-building coral. The corals Pocillopora acuta and Porites compressa were in KƒÅne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i and acclimated to 5 levels of nutrient enrichment for a 5-week period.

Data - this folder contains all the raw data files required by the code files and will recreate all analyses and figures for the manuscript. 

  Isotope nubbins.csv - the list of all corals analyzed for stable isotopes. 
  Isotopes_raw.csv - raw stable isotope data that is merged with metadata from the above file.
  Kaneohe_historical_nutrients.csv - baseline nutrient concentrations for the study site from Drupp et al. 2011.
  Kbay_nutrients_experimental.csv - weekly measurements of nutrients and water chemistry from experimental aquaria.
  PAM_master_file.csv - master file of all maximum quantum yield measurements for the experiment.
  Phys_master_file.csv - master file with all physiological parameters measured during the study.
  Tank_irradiance.csv - ambient irradiance data recorded in the center of the experimental tank set up over the experiment.
